# PuffyLauncher

The launcher is written in **pure JavaFX**, using the JFOENIX & JNATIVE(Stylization). 🌏

## Requirements:

- JDK 20+
- Gradle 8+
- [MinecraftCli](https://github.com/TeamLeak/MinecraftCli)
- [Launcher-Backend](https://github.com/TeamLeak/Launcher-backend)

Yes, I'll note right away, 
**the launcher launches only those builds that use my Minecraft Cli** as the basis.
In short, this is a **combined Minecraft JAR client.**

**Also, my version of the BACKEND is required, for the launcher to work.**

## Advantages:

- [x] Works on **new versions of JAVA.** 🈵
- [x] The interface is built through **JAVAFX and FXML -> simple customization.** 📃
- [x] **Simple** code. 🎂
- [x] **Session support.** 💀
